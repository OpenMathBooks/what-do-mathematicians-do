  <title>A whirlwind tour of mathematics</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Soon we'll be exploring a variety of mathematical topics, but
      before we can do that, we need to first learn how to start asking
      the right questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider this chapter to be the introduction... to our introduction
      into the world of mathematics. Here we'll look at some things that
      (1) we think are interesting, (2) introduce us to the math community, and
  (3) provide some context that we'll find helpful later. </p>
