    <introduction>
        <p>
            Welcome to your mathematics department! Whether you're a
            freshman new to campus altogether, or you're a seasoned college student
            starting a new journey in a mathematics program, getting to know
            your local community of faculty and peers is the best way to make
            this program your home.

            You're probably here because you think math is, at some level,
            fun! And why should you have all that fun on your own, when you
            have several other peers who share that feeling with you?
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want to get the most out of your mathematics program,
            the first thing you should do is connect with the commmunity
            of peers that are studying alongside you.
            Whether you consider yourself a natural mathematician, or
            someone who enjoys figuring out mathematical topics through
            hard work, the most successful math students are those who
            get involved early and often, so we encourage you to be an
            active part of your local mathematical community.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are some likely opportunities for you to get invovled.
            (Ask your instructor which
            ones are happening on your campus — if they aren't, maybe you
            can be the one who makes it happen!)

            <title>Math Club</title>
            <p>
                Math clubs are student-led organizations
                that get together frequently to play games,
                eat some food, and (at least on occasion) sneak in some math!
                Club members typically help each other with resumes, networks,
                projects, and more.
            </p>

                        holding cards that say "Dos" on their backs,
                        similar to Uno playing cards.

            <p>
                Math clubs are often registered organizations of their school's
                student government association,
                which can mean they are eligible for appropriated
                funds paid from those student activities you cough up each
                semester. (No better way to pay for club refreshments,
                or even cover travel to an undergraduate math conference!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Some clubs might be affiliated as student
                chapters of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA),
                or even the Association of Computing &amp; Machining (ACM)
                if the club is in a joint mathematics and computer science
                department. In that case club membership could guarantee
                membership to one of these professional societies at a 
                discounted rate — ask the club's faculty advisor to learn more!

            <p>
                Several departments are associated with one or more
                disciplinary honor societies. One such society is
                <url href="https://pme-math.org">Pi Mu Epsilon</url>,
                dedicated to the promotion of mathematics and recognition
                of students who successfully pursue mathematical understanding.
                Honor societies often engage in the same kinds of activities
                as clubs (and frequently have joint meetings with the clubs
                to recruit future members), but are not open to all students:
                you'll need to apply with a high enough GPA to be eligible
                for the honor.

                In addition to beefing up your resume for your future
                job search or graduate school applications, you'll also
                be eligible to wear the cords of your honor society
                at graduation.

                Typical courses may not do much to disabuse this

        <title>Double Majors and Minors</title>

        <p> 
            Earning a degree in mathematics on its own is a great way towards
            a future career as an instructor and/or researcher of mathematics,
            and there are several industries that recruit mathematics majors
            directly, including quantitative finance and cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
            But out of the many careers described in the book
            <pubtitle>101 Careers in Mathematics</pubtitle>
            <xref ref="biblio-careers"/>, the vast majority of these are held
            by people that studied a relevant double major or minor, or
            went on to graduate school in another field.
        </p>
        <p>
            A mathematics major is very valuable, but pairing a math degree with another field will
            bring more opportunities than you might expect. We recommend either double-majoring or
            minoring in the following areas: <ul>
