  <title>Gearing up</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Before we dive into the math content itself, we want to take a moment to
      remember: even mathematicians are people. Even the most talented math
      student can't succeed on their own, and why would you want to?
    </p>
    <p>
      In these sections, we'll explore your local community of mathematics,
      share some tips for success in your students, and take a peek into
      the opportunities you could have after graduation.
