  <title>The Monty Hall Question</title>

<p>
    In the 1960's, there was a popular game show called "Let's Make a Deal" hosted by Monty Hall, in which a contestant was shown three doors. 
    Behind one door is a new car, and behind the other two doors are goats!
</p>

<p>
    After selecting a door, the host (Monty Hall) would open one of the unselected doors to reveal a goat. 
    For example, suppose the contestant selected door 1. At his point, Monty Hall might open door 3 to 
    reveal a goat as shown in the picture below.
</p>

<p>
    After opening door 3, the contestant gets a chance to change their selection. 
    In our example, the contestant may choose either door 1 again or door 2. 
</p>

<p>
    If you were playing and chose door 1, what is the probability that you have won the game?
</p>
<p>
    After Monty Hall revealed the goat in door 3, would you stick with door 1? Go with door 2? Does it really matter?
    After door 3 opens, and you have a choice of choosing door 1 or door 2, what is your probabilty of winning?
</p>

<p>
    We will try to answer these questions by collecting data and deducing empirical probability, and in this way we will
    convince ourselves regarding a winning strategy to "Let's Make a Deal".

    <p>
        Chose a partner. You and your partner will be dealt three cards: one face card, and two non-face cards. 
        We will say the face card is the car, and the non-face cards are the goats. 
        You will each take turns being the host and the contestant playing the game as follows.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The host (while the contestantâ€™s eyes are closed) will deal the three cards face down mentally 
                    knowing which card is the car.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The contestant points to a card.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The host will then flip over a goat card that the contestant did not point to.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The contestant has a chance to pick the other card or stay with the original choice.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Once the contestant has decided, the host reveals the winner.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The group records a win or a loss and if the contestant stuck with their first choice or switched
                    choices.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Each player plays 16 rounds (so 32 rounds in total). In half of the rounds, the contestants should chose to
        stick with the first choice. The contestants should decide to switch their choice in the rest of the rounds. Be
        sure to record for each match the outcome (win or lose) and the strategy (stick or switch)
    </p>

<p>
    Which player won the most? What strategy seems to work the best? It may be hard to say based on just 32 rounds. We need more
    data!

    <title>Collecting Data</title>
    <p>
        After all groups have finished playing their rounds, report your totals to your instructor. The class then
        will tabulate the results. 
    </p>
    
</activity>

<question>
    After seeing the tabulated results, is the probability of winning after door 3 is revealed
    1/2? What strategy seems to work better? Why?
</question>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-montyhallexplanation">
    <title>How does the Monty Hall Problem Work</title>

    <p>
        Calculating the probability of winning the Monty Hall game historically stumped 1000 PhD`s in Statistics! 
        So if you`re confused on why switching worked so much better than sticking, don`t feel bad!
    </p>

    <p>
        It seems like switching is the better strategy, but why? Why is it not 50-50? Suppose we are playing, 
        and we choose door 1. At this point, there is a 1/3 (33.33%) of winning. Maybe more importantly, 
        there is a 2/3 (66.66%) of losing!
    </p>

    <p>
        Now the host reveals that door 3 is a goat. So we now have a 1/2 chance of being correct, right? No! 
        The revelation that door 3 is a goat does not change our chance of winning being 1/3 (or losing being 2/3).
    </p>

    <p>
        So then if we switch after door 3 has been revealed, our chance of winning is actually 2/3!
    </p>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-100doors">
        <title>100 Doors!</title>
        
        <p>
            This question may become more obvious if we have more doors to choose from. 
            If there were 100 doors (with 99 goats) to pick from, and you choose door 1, would you feel good 
            about winning the car? You would be painfully aware that the chance of losing is 99/100.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, the host opens up 98 doors to reveal 98 goats. Wouldn't you feel good about the one door the 
            host did not open? You should! You would have a 99% chance of winning the car by switching!
