  <title>Probability: Coins and Dice</title>

<p>
    Your friend (not as diligent as you) did not study for his American History test. 
    It's multiple choice, so he knows he has a chance to get each answer correct by simply guessing. He
    feels lucky and is pretty confident about guessing his way to a passing grade.
</p>
<p>
    This exam has 25 questions with 4 answer choices each. So how likely is it that your friend passes the test? 
    There is .000043 (0.0043%) chance that your friend scores a 60\% or higher! Don't tell them him that though.
</p>

<p>
    It's amazing that little kids understand that a coin has a 50% chance of landing on heads. Somehow, ideas of 
    likelihood are built into us... but how can we move from intuitive concepts like dice rolls to complicated situations
    like passing a multiple choice test?

    Probability
  </p>
  <p> Probability is the mathematical tool we use to calculate the likelihood of an event, 
    and we find probability either through counting things or measuring area. Probability questions 
    handled by counting are called discrete probability questions. That's what we'll focus on in this section.

    <title>Coin Flips</title>

    <p>
        Let's start with this question: "If I flip two coins, how likely is it that they both land on heads?" This is 
        a pretty simple question but a great example of how to frame a probability question. Discrete probabilty questions
        can be calculated as follows:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Count all possible outcomes of the situation in question.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Count the outcomes that we care about.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Divide the count of outcomes we care about by the count of total outcomes.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <question>
      <statement>  Let <m>S</m> be the set of outcomes from flipping two coins. What are the elements of <m>S</m>? </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            <m>S = {TT, TH, HT, HH}</m>. So we have <m>|S| = 4</m> possibilities.
        </p>
    </solution>
    </question>

    <question>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>A</m> be the set of outcomes we're interested in (two heads). How many elements are in <m>A</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                <m>A = {HH}</m>, so <m>|A| = 1</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </question>

    <question>
        <statement>
            <p>
                So what's the probabilty of flipping two heads in two coin flips?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The probability of two heads in two clip then is <m>|A|/|S| = 1/4</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </question>

    <p>
        We can now define the probability of event <m>A</m> as <m>P(A) = \dfrac{|A|}{|S|}</m>, where <m>S</m> is the 
        set of all possible outcomes (called the sample space).
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's practice this idea.
    </p>

    <question>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What is the probability of flipping exactly one head in two coin flips?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We have the same sample space as before <m>{TT, TH, HT, HH}</m>, and <m>A = {TH, HT}</m>.
                So <m>P(A) = \dfrac{|A|}{|S|} = \dfrac{2}{4}</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </question>

    <question>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What is the probability of flipping exactly one head in three coin flips?  (Find the universal and event sets.)
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Here <m>S = {TTT, TTH, THT, HTT, THH, HTH, HHT, HHH}</m> and <m>A = {TTH, THT, HTT}</m>, so 
                <m>P(A) = \dfrac{|A|}{|S|} = \dfrac{3}{8}</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </question>

    <title>Dice Rolls</title>
    
    <p>
     Let's look at a different context.
    </p>

    <question>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Some card games require coin flips from time to time, and players often roll a six-side die instead
                of flipping a coin. In these instance, an odd roll is tails and an even is heads.
            </p>

            <p>
                Explain why this is equivalent to a coin flip.
            </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
            <p>
                What is the probability <m>A</m>, the event of rolling an even? We know <m>A = \{2,4,6\}</m>,
                and so <m>P(A) = \dfrac{3}{6} = \dfrac{1}{2}</m>. So rolling an even has the same probability as
                flipping heads. 
            </p>
        </solution>
    </question>

    <p>
        Another one:
    </p>

    <question>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What is the probability of rolling a sum of 7 when rolling two six-sided die?
            </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
            <p>
                Think of two rolls as an ordered pair. So <m>S = \{(1,1),(1,2),\ldots, (5,6),(6,6) \}</m>.
                Also we can add to 7 in several ways, <m>A = \{(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \}</m>.
                So <m>P(A) = \dfrac{6}{36} = \dfrac{1}{6}</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </question>
