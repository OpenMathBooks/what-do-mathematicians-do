</h3>
<div class="para" id="preface-2">Welcome to <span class="booktitle">What Do Mathematicians Do?</span>! This book is different in its aim from most mathematics texts that you’ll encounter. Rather than attempting to dig into a specific area within mathematics (calculus, algebra, topology...) <span class="booktitle">What Do Mathematicians Do?</span> provides a look at what we do as mathematicians in general.</div>
<section class="paragraphs" id="preface-3"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Who is this book for?</span></h3>
<div class="para" id="preface-3-2">Incoming math majors often choose their major because of the success they had in high school. Others switch into it after deciding another STEM major wasn’t for them, and guess which credits they had in their pocket already? But what do math majors <em class="emphasis">actually do</em>? And not just during school, but after graduation as well?</div>
<div class="para" id="preface-3-3">This text is intended for a first-time or prospective math major (or even minor!) to get a glimpse of things on the path that they will soon be walking along.</div></section><section class="paragraphs" id="preface-4"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">What this book is not.</span></h3>
<div class="para" id="preface-4-2">This book is certainly not exhaustive in any sense. We will not turn over every stone on any given subject, and will frankly look at several subjects at just a surface level. And that’s okay! We’re here just to start some conversations, and you should feel free to chat with your instructor if there’s anything here that leaves you wanting more; we’re sure they’d be more than happy to recommend future courses or directed studies that will help you advance those mathematical inquries!</div></section><section class="paragraphs" id="preface-5"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">So what is the point of this book?</span></h3>

<dfn class="terminology">Be curious about things!</dfn> It is very difficult to learn about things if you have no interest in them.

<dfn class="terminology">Procrastination is NOT your friend.</dfn> It is easy to push off an assignment here or there to another time. Somedays are about balancing competing priorities, but in the long run procrastination will only make things worse. Avoid avoiding when possible.</div></li>
<li id="subsec-tips-3-5"><div class="para" id="subsec-tips-3-5-1">

In 450 BC, Indian mathematician, Pingata, called this new construction the "Staircase of Mount Meru". Persian mathematician, Omar Khayyam, discovered "Khauuam’s Triangle" in the 11th century, and close to the same time, Chinese mathematician, Jin Xian, discovered "Yang Hui’s Triangle". In the western world, this triangle is most commonly refered to as Pascal’s Triangle, named after french mathematician, Blaise Pascal, who discovered this triangle in the 17th century.

<div class="para" id="subsec-argue-intro-2">The political scene of ancient Greece was pretty wild. City-states separated by Greece’s rough terrain of mountains and the Mediterranean competed for power, and the wealthy and influential in each city wrestled for political influence for control of their community. Democracy allowed the people to decide on leadership and policy, and so rhetoric became the tool of competition among those seeking power.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-argue-intro-3">This may be hard to believe, but sometimes politicians try to convince their audience to take a position with improper tactics. We would say that in these instances they make a flawed argument. Circa 300 BC, as the Greek politicians scrambled for influence, the great philosopher Aristotle began developing a system to analyze arguments. This system became what we know as "classical logic", and because of his work, Aristotle (382-322 BC)is known as the father of logic. <figure class="figure figure-like" id="subsec-argue-intro-3-1"><div class="image-box" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"><img src="external/aristotle.jpg" class="contained"></div>

<div class="para" id="sec-polarcoords-2-5">Coordinates like we see at the bumper cars are called <dfn class="terminology">rectangular coordinates</dfn> (because they fit nicely in a rectangular grid).

  "body": " What Do Mathematicians Do?  An Overview of Undergraduate Mathematics     Steven Clontz Mathematics and Statistics University of South Alabama  John Estes Mathematics and Computer Science Belhaven University        copyright          The Goal of This Book  Welcome to What Do Mathematicians Do? ! This book is different in its aim from most mathematics texts that you'll encounter. Rather than attempting to dig into a specific area within mathematics (calculus, algebra, topology...) What Do Mathematicians Do? provides a look at what we do as mathematicians in general.   Who is this book for?  Incoming math majors often choose their major because of the success they had in high school. Others switch into it after deciding another STEM major wasn't for them, and guess which credits they had in their pocket already? But what do math majors actually do ? And not just during school, but after graduation as well?  This text is intended for a first-time or prospective math major (or even minor!) to get a glimpse of things on the path that they will soon be walking along.    What this book is not  This book is certainly not exhaustive in any sense. We will not turn over every stone on any given subject, and will frankly look at several subjects at just a surface level. And that's okay! We're here just to start some conversations, and you should feel free to chat with your instructor if there's anything here that leaves you wanting more; we're sure they'd be more than happy to recommend future courses or directed studies that will help you advance those mathematical inquries!    So what is the point of this book?  In short, this book seeks to introduce students to the wonderful world of mathematics and its vibrant community.  In particular, we hope to introduce  the culture of the mathematics community, both locally within a local college or university, and across broader worldwide community of mathematicians,  snapshots of novel math topics that (tragically!) aren't often explored in the typical high school math classroom, and  skills to maximize success in a mathematics program.  Not to mention: we hope to have some fun while doing it!    The secret to success...  The single best practice for this course is just showing up with a good attitude and a curiosity to learn more about mathematics.   Let's get started!      Gearing Up   Before we dive into the math content itself, we want to take a moment to remember: even mathematicians are people. Even the most talented math student can't succeed on their own, and why would you want to?  In these sections, we'll explore your local community of mathematics, share some tips for success in your students, and take a peek into the opportunities you could have after graduation.     Introducing... Your Math Department!   Welcome to your mathematics department! Whether you're a freshman new to campus altogether, or you're a seasoned college student starting a new journey in a mathematics program, getting to know your local community of faculty and peers is the best way to make this program your home.    Community    Photograph of Belhavan University math students at the 2024 sectional meeting of the Mathematical Association of America.   Nine college students of multiple races and genders stand together in an academic building hallways wearing nametags.    You're probably here because you think math is, at some level, fun! And why should you have all that fun on your own, when you have several other peers who share that feeling with you?  If you want to get the most out of your mathematics program, the first thing you should do is connect with the commmunity of peers that are studying alongside you. Whether you consider yourself a natural mathematician, or someone who enjoys figuring out mathematical topics through hard work, the most successful math students are those who get involved early and often, so we encourage you to be an active part of your local mathematical community.  Here are some likely opportunities for you to get invovled. (Ask your instructor which ones are happening on your campus — if they aren't, maybe you can be the one who makes it happen!)    Math Club  Math clubs are student-led organizations that get together frequently to play games, eat some food, and (at least on occasion) sneak in some math! Club members typically help each other with resumes, networks, projects, and more.   Belhavan Univeristy math club students playing a round of Dos.   Several students sit in a classroom with long tables. Upfront are three young men and a woman holding cards that say \"Dos\" on their backs, similar to Uno playing cards.    Math clubs are often registered organizations of their school's student government association, which can mean they are eligible for appropriated funds paid from those student activities you cough up each semester. (No better way to pay for club refreshments, or even cover travel to an undergraduate math conference!)  Some clubs might be affiliated as student chapters of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), or even the Association of Computing & Machining (ACM) if the club is in a joint mathematics and computer science department. In that case club membership could guarantee membership to one of these professional societies at a discounted rate — ask the club's faculty advisor to learn more!   Belhaven students hosting an outdoor social event.   Four students stand around a folding table on a campus lawn. The table is covered with various colorful gadgets.      Honors Societies  Several departments are associated with one or more disciplinary honor societies. One such society is Pi Mu Epsilon , dedicated to the promotion of mathematics and recognition of students who successfully pursue mathematical understanding. Honor societies often engage in the same kinds of activities as clubs (and frequently have joint meetings with the clubs to recruit future members), but are not open to all students: you'll need to apply with a high enough GPA to be eligible for the honor.   Seal of the Pi Mu Epsilon mathematics honor society.   A purple disk with a gold design of the pin in center, and the words Pi Mu Epsilon, Incorporated around the edge with gold trim.    In addition to beefing up your resume for your future job search or graduate school applications, you'll also be eligible to wear the cords of your honor society at graduation.    Department and College Events  Showing up to department and college events is important to not only connect with peers in the math major, but also to network with your school's broader STEM community. Often food is involved too...  Be on the lookout for:   Sporting events: your department or college may offer a tailgate for students and alumni before the football homecoming game.   Belhavan students and alumni at their homecoming tailgate.      Free food: lunch before finals, burgers at a picnic, cookies and donuts... Most departments try to find plenty of opportunities to break bread with one another.    Merch: Your math club or department may have shirts or hoodies to help you show off your association with mathematics at your college.    Outreach: Help us give back to your community by participating in events that get the public engaged in STEM! Many schools have programs such as math circles, puzzle festivals, and science fairs that can get everyone having fun while solving mathematical problems.   Belhavan students at their Naturefest outreach event.   Several adults at a table with parchment paper. Several combinatorial graphs are drawn on the paper, with tokens positioned at some vertices. Plush Super Mario and two Koopa Shell dolls are at the table as well.         Connect and communicate with others  Good communication is criminally undervalued by some math students. Go talk to your professors! They want to know you better! Meet your classmates! They're going to help you through your that tough assignmnent.  If your department has a social platform such as a Facebook group or Discord server, log in and join the conversation to stay in touch with everyone.     Academic Experiences   Your degree is measured in credit hours. You're taking classes ultimately to earn a degree. You'll also expect some grades in those classes. BUT let's be careful not to mistake grades and credit hours with actual learning. Our goal in the MCS Department is provide an environment of true learning. We want you to adapt a mentality of a continual learning: one who learns inside and outside of the classroom.  In addition to core classes such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, and Differential Equations, Belhaven's MCS department delivers a number of curriculum add-ons. Let's take a look at what additional academic experiences we offer.    STEM Seminar  Meet professional scientists and mathematicians who share about what they do, how they got there, and how you can too. This is a great way to find internships and jobs.       Mathematical Research  In MAT 391, 392, 491 and 492, students participate in the mathematical research process reviewing recent results of a select topic and attempting to further it. These students will present their findings as a poster and presentation at the Belhaven University Undergraduate Research Symposium (BUURS) and our sectional meetings of the MAA.           Belhaven Maker Campus  The Belhaven Maker Campus is a collaboration between Math & Computer Science and Art & Design featuring formative technologies such as 3D printers, CAD drawing systems, laser engraving, and more. We are a community of engineering students, artists, and mathematicians wanting to get our hands busy making things with technology.     Join the Maker Campus, and you can gain access to both of our campuses maker labs. Design your own creations and 3D print them! Customize your gear with laser etching or make custom stickers. There are a lot of possibilities, and the Maker Campus is designed to make your ideas a reality.          For Engineering Majors  In addition to academic experiences math majors experience, students in Belhaven's engineering partnership  learn AutoCAD in PHY 119 Intro to Engineering  interact with professional engineers from places like Yates construction, Raytheon, and Asset Engineering.  take site visits to Ole Miss, Mississippi State, and places like Nissan and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center (ERDC).         For Actuarial Science Majors  For those majoring in Actuarial Sciences (ASM), students will  learn statistical software such as R,  sit for the first actuarial exam, the Probability Exam (SOA Exam P).         Double Major and Minors  A mathematics major is very valuable, but pairing a math degree with another field will bring more opportunities than you might expect. We recommend either double-majoring or minoring in the following areas:   Computer Science    Chemistry or Physics    Business or Accounting    Tradigital Art     Besides these recommended degrees, we have had double majors in Dance, Theatre, Music, History, English, and so much more.     How to be a successful math major\/minor   Introduction  How do you succeed as a math student? What does success even look like for a mathematician?  College is a unique time to invest wholeheartedly in yourself. It is an enormous opportunity to build your skills, make valuable connections, and lay a foundation for your future. Even as a freshman, having a good plan for approaching your studies will make your life much, much easier.  Before going too far towards your degree in mathematics, it is worth spending time considering how to be a successful mathematics student. We will spend a few minutes now discussing a good strategy to making the most of your college tenure as a math student.   Math People   Think about people you know who are \"good\" at mathematics? What traits do they have that you feel made them \"good\" at mathematics?    Let's get introspective for a moment. What about yourself? At what moments do you feel you have been successful in mathematics?   Past Experiences   Think about your past experiences in mathematics courses. When were you most successful? What practices helped you be successful?      Tips for Success  Now let's look towards the future. Ask yourself \"What can I do to be a successful math student NOW?\" This is not always an easy question to answer, and honestly everyone will have to answer it differently. However, we can provide a few guiding points that may help you develop a strategy to do well in your mathematical coursework.     Be curious about things! It is very difficult to learn about things if you have no interest in them. We can practice curiosity (which leads to deeper learning) by simply asking \"why\" more often. Mathematics, especially, encourages us to wonder why things operate the way they do.     Don't just be a note taker! Notes can be helpful, but do not think writing down whatever is on the board is enough to have a good class. It is easy to take notes without thinking about what is actually happening in class.     Be alert in class. Come to class ready to be engaged. Ask questions. You paid for the time. Don't waste it!     Procrastination is NOT your friend. It is easy to push off an assignment here or there to another time. Somedays are about balancing competing priorities, but in the long run procrastination will only make things worse. Avoid avoiding when possible.     Consistent work leads to consistent success. Try to approach your school work like you would a workout routine. Lifting weights once a week helps some, but if you are serious about bulking up, then you know you need to hit the gym more frequently than once a week. Bring the same mindset, and with consistend work you will see gains in understanding and performance.    People associate good math-ing with intelligence. There is some truth to that, but there are things we can do to increase our level of success. While we cannot control our intelligence, Work ethic is in your control.   What speaks to you?   After reviewing the previous points, what speaks to you? What can you do to prepare yourself to be a successful mathematics student?      Putting it into practice   If you are in a mathematics course this semester, make a plan to your approach to the course.  Ask yourself the following questions:   What can I do to engage in class?    Pick a regular time in the week reserved to work on homework. When will that be?    Who can I study with? When will I study?    Where is my instructor's office? When are their office hours?         Meeting Classmates  Find four classmates in your class that you have not met before. Ask them the following questions:   What is you name?    What is your major?    Where are you from?    What's one interesting fact about you?     Finish your introduction with each person by picking a unique codeword to share just between the two of you. Example: \"truncated\".      Careers in Mathematics   Introduction  What can you do with your degree? What doors does a background in mathematics open? What is a mathematician? You can be a math teacher, but what if you're not interested in education as a career?  It's good to be thinking of life after college, even if you just started your college days. A little research into what career options are open to you will help set a vision for your future, and a vision for the future will provide a path of clear steps to get you there.  Remember:   There is no success without discipline.    There is no discipine without vision.     Also remember that a huge part of the college experience is exploring options and figuring out what path fits you best. Do not feel pressured to have everything figured out yet. Here we are simply showing what's out here.   What Careers are there?   Northwestern University compiled a list of careers using mathematics. Read through the article Best Math Careers.     Do any of these careers seem interesting to you?   What Careers are there?   Find three careers (one of them resulting directly from a mathematics degree) that you can follow with your degree. Be sure to include your sources.     Canvas Discussion   Locate the Canvas discussion post \"Mathematical Careers\", and share a resource highlighting one of the careers you found to be interesting.     Career Interest   Do any of the careers you mentioned or found in Canvas seem like a career you would like to pursue? Why or why not?     Steps Towards a Career   After reviewing several careers, choose one and describe steps you can take to obtain that position.      College after college  Some of us are destined for more school than others. You might find yourself wanting more math than what your undergrad experience can accommodate. It could be that you decide to earn a Master's or a PhD.  If you have any interest in graduate school, you'll want to make sure to build a resume of things graudate programs look for.   high GPA    interest in research (conferences, posters, thesis)    a Research Experience for Undergrads (REU) if possible.         A whirlwind tour of mathematics   Soon we'll be exploring a variety of mathematical topics, but before we can do that, we need to first learn how to start asking the right questions.  Consider this chapter to be the introduction... to our introduction into the world of mathematics. Here we'll look at some things that (1) we think are interesting, (2) introduce us to the math community, and (3) provide some context that we'll find helpful later.      Shopping Carts and Sets   Introduction  Sunday afternoon at the local supermarket is a bustling place. Shoppers cut each other off for the last jar of salsa with a smile and a 'pardon me'. Amid the somewhat friendly and mostly competitive crowd, long-time friends Yuri and Kalo bump into each other in front of the cauliflower. It's always a bit awkward looking into someone else's shopping cart (feels like a violation of privacy, right?), but Yuri couldn't help but notice that there was some overlap.  \"Hey, I like rice cakes, too. Look!\" exclaimed Yuri holding up a bag of rice cakes from his cart.   Anyway... the two carts looked like this:     Yuri's cart  Kalo's cart    rice cakes  rice cakes    cauliflower  cauliflower    halibut  tuna    coffee creamer  crab legs    spicy ramen  spicy ramen    cilantro  parsley    yellow onion  purple onion    corn chips  cookies    salami  bagels    eggs  salami      cream cheese       Collections of Things  There's some mathematics going on here. Anytime we find a collection of items (like a shopping cart) we have a mathematical object called a set.  A set is simply a collection of objects that we refer to as elements .  Let's call the set of Yuri's cart , written as { rice cakes, cauliflower, halibut, coffee creamer, spicy ramen, cilantro, yellow onion, corn chips, salami, eggs } . Similarly {rice cakes, cauliflower, tuna, crab legs, spicy ramen, parsley, purple onion, cookies, bagels, salami, and cream cheese} is the set representing Kalo's cart. So halibut is an element of (written as halibet ), and tuna .  We could make a list of the items that both Yuri and Kalo have in their carts, and this overlap between their two carts represents the \"intersection of Y and K\", denoted .  In general for sets and , the intersection of and  , , is the set of elements in both sets.    Intesection of and , .       Yuri and Kalo's intersection   What does contain?     = {rice cakes, cauliflower, spicy ramen, salami}    Another friend interrupts Yuri and Kalo's meeting. JACOBI greets them both as they unapologetically rifle through his cart.  JACOBI's cart is represented by the set {spicy ramen, cilantro, corn chips, and eggs}. Yuri can't help notice that everything in is also in . In this case, we say that is a subset of , denoted or .    A set is a subset of if for any element , we know also that .      A subset of , .      Subsets of Dairy   Let be the set of all dairy items. Find a subset of that is also a subset of .    The subset we're looking for must be a set of dairy items in Kalo's cart: , for example.  That is, {cream cheese}.     Is the intersection a subset?   Is a subset of ?    Yes! Any element in is also an element of .    Unbeknownst to Kalo, Kalo's wife MARNIE is also in the grocery store with {cauliflower, macaroni, purple onion, water, bacon}. When Kalo and MARNIE bump into each other, they decide to finish their shopping and to consolidate their items to one cart. Kalo reshelves the cauliflower and purple onion, though, since MARNIE already has those items in her cart. This new cart is known as the \"union of K and M\", .    In general, for sets and , the union of and , , is the collection of elements that are in either set (or both).      Union of and , .      Question of union   What is ?     Another question of union   What is ?     More complicated sets   What about ?      An empty cart  After Kalo and Marnie consolidate their carts, somebody snags Kalo's now empty cart. This makes Kalo consider how an empty cart relates to sets.      Can a set have 0 elements?    Definitely!    Actually, that empty cart is symbolic of a very important set. The empty set is the set with no elements. We denote it as .      Give an example of two sets, and for which .    There are millions of examples. For example, let be the set of all species of turtles and be the set of flying creatures. Come up with your on example.      Venn Diagrams  A common way to picture sets and how they interact is with overlapping circles. You have already seen a few such images in this section. We call these figures Venn diagrams, named after mathematician John Venn (1834-1923), and they help us quickly recognize how given sets are related.  For example, consider the sets , , and . Are sets such as or obvious? The Venn diagram makes these relationships obvious.         Use the Venn diagram to provide .    We can see .    It's also fairly common to find Venn diagram memes. You should do a quick internet search to see for yourself.       How about we look at sets of actors from popular movie franchises?      More sets later Remember that our goal is to introduce you to topics you'll cover in more detail later. There are other set operations that we won't cover here. You'll see these in classes like Discrete Mathematics, Modern Algebra, and many others.    Set Activities   Human Venn Diagrams  Your class will now be a human Venn diagram (This works best in an open area). Each of you will receive an idex card. On your index card, write (1) an integer, (2) a color, and (3) an animal.  For example, your card may include   73    tangerine    pangolin.     Your instructor will designate one part of the room (or area) for set , another for set , and a third area for set .  Now for the game. Your instructor will call out (or write on the board) what the three sets represent. At that point, you must move to the location on the Venn diagram that fits your card.  For example, suppose your instructor calls out (or writes) \" is the set even integers, is the set of warm colors (yellows, oranges, reds), and is the set of predatory animals. Compare those sets to your card. It appears is the only set you are a part of, so move on to that section of the Venn diagram. The quicker, the better.     Play a few rounds.    Crafting Sets  For this activity, the class will be divided groups. The instructor will give either an element or a set of elements as well as a set operator (either union or intersection). The group is challenged to find two sets whose union or intersection (whichever is specified) is the given element or subset.  For example, suppose your instructor says \" and \". Your group could let and since .      A Special Triangle   Introduction      You can find all sorts of interesting examples of surprising structures in the universe of mathematics. One such example is a very special triangle of numbers that's easy to construct and borderline ubiquitous in its applications.  This triangle goes by many names and was discovered by several cultures in history. In 450 BC, Indian mathematician, Pingata, called this new construction the \"Staircase of Mount Meru\". Persian mathematician, Omar Khayyam, discovered \"Khauuam's Triangle\" in the 11th century, and close to the same time, Chinese mathematician, Jin Xian, discovered \"Yang Hui's Triangle\". In the western world, this triangle is most commonly refered to as Pascal's Triangle, named after french mathematician, Blaise Pascal, who discovered this triangle in the 17th century. REFERENCE      The Pingata, Khauuman's Triangle, and Yang Hui's Triangle     Constructing Pascal's Triangle  Now we will follow the foot steps of giants. We can build Pascal's Triangle by listing out the rows. For the first row (row ), we just write , and the second row is composed of . The third row (what we call row 2) consists of like below.      The pattern of Pascal's Triangle is not immediately obvious for us yet. The in row 2 comes from adding the two 's above it in row 1. For the next row (row 3), we start with . The next entry consists of the sum of the two numbers above it ( ). Next is the sum , and finally we end the row with . That is, row 3 is .  Then we just repeat this process.     Row 4   Fill out row 4 of Pascal's Triangle.    Following the same process, row 4 has entries or .      Fill out the first 8 rows of Pascal's Triangle.    Patterns of Pacal's Triangle  Pascal's triangle has interested mathematicians for centuries, as it is filled with interesting patterns.     Adding along a row   Add entries of rows 0 through 4. What pattern do you notice?    The sume of entries of rows 0 through 4 are respectively. These looks like powers of .    We just uncovered that the sum of entries along row add up to . This is just one pattern of Pascal's triangle, but there are many more. Wadji Mohamed Retemi expertly hightlights some of these patterns we find in Pascal's triangle in this Ted Ed video.

Tetrahedral Numbers   What is the 5th tetrahedral number?       Logically Speaking   Introduction  Let's assume that if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then the dezapatos changs the wungwing. Also, we all know that if the dezapatos changs the wungwing, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale. But does that means that if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale?  What? What was that?  You have probably seen theorem statements in textbooks like the Mean Value Theorem below. If you are like me, then you probably skipped all of the words and jumped to the big equation. Right?   Mean Value Theorem   If is a function that is continuous on and differentiable on , then there is a number in such that     It's okay if you have no idea what any of that means. The Mean Value Theorem will have more meaning in Calculus. For now, just notice that has the form if some stuff then some more stuff.  Actually, the nonsensical paragraph opening this session has several \" if some stuff then some more stuff\" statements. These type of statements are called conditional statements, and we can represent them symbolically like . We we know logically that implies that if occurs, then will follow.    Gordentockles and Chimi  Earlier we were asked whether we know for sure that if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale. Let's represent the statement \"gordentockles borg the headenvorsh\" with , the statement \"the dezapatos changs the wungwing\" with , and the statement \"chimi dupas the mongo-gale\" with .      How would we represent symbolically the statement \"if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then the dezapatos changs the wungwing\"?    This is a conditional statement: .      How would we represent symbolically the statement \"if the dezapatos changs the wungwing, then the chimi dupas the mongo-gale\"?    This is a conditional statement: .    From and , we have two conditionals and . So if occurs, then occurs, and if occurs, then so does . So is it not true then, that if occurs, then occurs?    What does mean? And is it true based upon what we know?    The conditional statement reads as \"if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale\", and it is true based upon what we know.      The Usefulness of Logic  Logic helps us safely traverse through mathematical statements. As we'll see later, all proof writing depends on principles of logic, and having a good understanding of the basics of logic will help us make sense of things that are initially unintuitive.  The past few exercises showed a couple of things. Firstly, that we can follow the logic of an argument even if we're not overly familiar with the contents of the article. Do we even know what a gordentockle is? Secondly, we arrived to some transitive form of conditionals. We decided that if and , then . Logicians can string together simpler logic statements to arrive to new, more complicated statements.  Take a look at the tree REF below, in which each edge is a conditional statement.       If is true, what else do we know for sure is true?    We know and is true, so is true.      Starting with , what things must be true to guarantee that is true?    To guarantee that is true, we must have to be true as well. Note that we do not know if this is only reason is true or not, but the way we can guarantee it.      Suppose is not true. What else do we know for sure is not true?    It is tempting to say that and are not true, but we don't know that actually! What we know is that . So if is true and is false, then we have a contradiction. So if is false, then must be false.      Contrapositives   gave us a new rule of logic. Supposing is true and is false, we now know that must be false. We'll write to mean \"not \", and so our new rule could be stated as .  This new statement, , is called the contrapositive , and the conditional and the contrapostive are logically equivalent statments. This means, that if one is true, then they're both true, and if one is false, they're both false.  Contrapositives are very useful.    What is the contrapostive of the statment \"if the dezapatos changs the wungwing, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale\"?    If chimi does not dupas the mongo-gale, then the dezapatos does not chang the wungwing.      Make up three conditional \"if-then\" statements and write them down. Trade your conditionals with a classmate and write the contrapositive to your classmate's conditional statements.      Knights and Knaves  Mathematician (and magician) Raymond Smullyan (1919-2017) famously wrote several books of logic puzzles. The puzzles have entertained and challenged people for decades. You can find a list of his works at the https:\/\/www.raymondsmullyan.com\/bio\/    Raymond Smullyan (1919-2017)   One set of his puzzles involve the reader (you) visiting an island in which there lives two types of people. Knights ALWAYS tell the truth, and Knaves ALWAY lie. In many of these puzzles, you engage in a brief discussion with two or more island inhabitants, and based upon their statements you are challenged with identifying what type of people each person is.  Let's try a few.   Knight and Knaves I   You encounter two island residents, and , each is either a knight or a knave. makes the following statement: \"At least one of us is a knave.\" What are and ?     Knight and Knaves II   Suppose says, \"Either I am a knave or is a knight.\" What are and ?     Knight and Knaves III   This time, you encounter three people , each of whom is either a knight or knave. and make the following statements:    What are , and ?    You can more of Smullyan's logic puzzles on Dan Mackinnon's github page .    Samurai Jack and the Wyrm  In the early 2000's, the Cartoon Network hit, Samurai Jack explored a Smullyan-style logic puzzle. In the show, Jack is desparately trying to return to his proper time in history hears a rumor of a two-headed wyrm with the power of time travel.  The two heads of the wyrm tell him that one head only tells the truth and the other only tells lies (Sound familiar?), and Jack has to determine which one is which. If he answers correctly, the truth telling head will devour Jack, and that process will send Jack back to the past.      SPOILER ALERT: Unfortunately for Jack, both heads lie, and the entire exercise was just a trick. Don't worry, though, Jack escapes mostly in good health.     Good Arguments   Introduction  The political scene of ancient Greece was pretty wild. City-states separated by Greece's rough terrain of mountains and the Mediterranean competed for power, and the wealthy and influential in each city wrestled for political influence for control of their community. Democracy allowed the people to decide on leadership and policy, and so rhetoric became the tool of competition among those seeking power.  This may be hard to believe, but sometimes politicians try to convince their audience to take a position with improper tactics. We would say that in these instances they make a flawed argument. Circa 300 BC, as the Greek politicians scrambled for influence, the great philosopher Aristotle began developing a system to analyze arguments. This system became what we know as \"classical logic\", and because of his work, Aristotle (382-322 BC)is known as the father of logic.   Aristotle    To know how to analyze arguments, we should define what an argument is. An argument is simply a sequence of logical statements. The conclusion of an arugment is the ending statement of the argument, and a premise is a logical statement used to support the conclusion.  For example: All cheaters sit in the back row. Monty sits in the back row. Therefore, Monty is a cheater.    Without any knowledge of how to validate an argument, do you think the previous argument is a valid one?    So an argument is a sequence of statements? Obviously we can make nonsensical sequences of statements, so how do we know if an argument is a good one or not? We say an argument is valid if the conclusion is logically supported by its premises, so the argument from is not valid since non-cheaters could sit in the back row.    Common Arguments   Introduction  So how do we determine an argument to be valid? With logic.  Good understanding of logic can help us determine whether a given argument is valid or not. We already looked at some basic logic principles in , namely the conditional and the contrapositive . These two statements provide the framework of the two most basic, valid arguments.    Modus Ponens  The modus ponens argument (translated from \"affirming mode\") consists of three parts             Therefore, .     The modus ponens argument is simply saying, \"if happens, then so does and happens (or is true). Therefore, happens as well (or is also true)\". This is definitely a valid argument.   Modus Ponens  For example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore Socrates is mortal.    Modus Ponens   Craft a modus ponens argument of your own.      Modus Tollens  Like modus ponens, the modus tollens argument (translated from \"method of denying\") consists of three parts             Therefore, .     The modus tollens argument makes use of the contrapositive. It's saying, \"if happens, then so does and does not happen (or is false). Therefore, does not happen (or is also false)\". This is also a valid argument.   Modus Tollens  For example: If it's a bird, then it lays eggs. It does not lay eggs. Therefore, it's not a bird.    Modus Tollens   Craft a modus tollens argument of your own.       Common Errors   Introduction  What about this example? If it's a bird, then it lays eggs. It lays eggs. Therefore, it's a bird. Is this a valid argument?    Converse Errors  Nah. This is not a valid argument.  We just made converse error , and invalide argument of the form        q    Therefore, .     But we can think of several instances in which this is not a valid argument.   Eggs and Birds?   We incorrectly concluded that since it lays eggs, it's a bird. Give an example where this is false.    Sadly, converse errors are used all the time! Feel empowered to recognize them and point them out!    Inverse Errors  What about this example? If the boy rides his skateboard wrecklessly, then he will break his arm. He did not ride his skateboard wrecklessly. Therefore, he did not break his arm.  There's more than one way to break an arm, right?  We just made an inverse error with this invalid argument form                   Remember, that an argument is valid if its conclusion is supported by its premises. The conclusion is not supported logically by the other premises.     More Arguments  Determine if the following are valid arguments or not.    All cheaters sit in the back row. Monty sits in the back row. Therefore, Monty is a cheater.      All freshman must take writing. Caroline is a freshman. Therefore, Caroline must take writing.      All honest people pay their taxes. Darth is not honest. Therefore, Darth does not pay his taxes.      If an infinite series converges, then its terms go to 0. The terms of the infinite series do not go to 0. The infinite series does not converge.       Connecting Dots   intro      Jane and her friend Julia were invited to a small get together at their friend Julio's place. When they arrive, they don't really know any of the other four people (other than Julio) who seem to know each other EXCEPT one of the four coincidentally is Jane's cousin, Elaine.     Julio's party   This type situations happen all of the time. If you're sitting in a classroom, you're in a similar situation right now. When you are with a group of people, you are a part of a mathematical structure known as a graph . Actually, any network (relationships, pipe systems, road maps, the internet, ...) can be represented as a graph.     Various graphs   We see graphs anytime we have a collection of items (We call them vertices or nodes .) and relationships between those items (We call the relationships edges .). In fact, it is by the vertices and edges that we define a graph.    A graph G is a pair of two sets and , where is the set of vertices and is the set of edges on .       Drawing a Graph   Draw the graph with vertex set and edge set .    Graph theorists study all sort aspects of graphs. We ask questions about the longest path of a graph, how easy is it to break up a graph with vertex or edge deletions, and if we can draw a graph in the plane without crossing any edges (among many others).  We'll explore a few interesting graph theory questions here.    Touring the City of Königsburg      If we happen to find ourselves in Königsburg Prussia in the 18th century, we would see a city layout similar to the one in . The Pregel river flowed through the middle of the city forming two islands. The part we care about, though, is the seven highlighted bridges.  Residents such as ourselves, as a game, would often attempt to tour the city with these rules:   You must cross each bridge (all 7) exactly one time (no more and no less).    You must end your tour exactly where you began.   A tour that meets these requirements will be called a successful tour.    Can you find a successful tour of Königsburg?    This game peaked the interest of the incredibly brilliant mathematician, Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), and to solve this question Euler introduced the field of graph theory to the world. The Königsburg bridge problem is considered the to be the first instance graph theory historically. Like Euler, we can picture Königsburg as a graph by treating the bridges as edges and use vertices to represent each land mass.    Represent Königsburg with a graph.            What do we mean by a \"tour\" on a graph? First, two edges are incident if they share a vertex. We can say a tour is a sequence of incident edges. We want to find a tour that includes every edge and begins and ends with the same vertex. This type of tour is called an eulerian circuit .  Euler's brilliance showed that by recognizing the only information needed for this problem was a marker for each piece of land and a way to represent their connections (the bridges), we can avoid being distracted by unnecessary information. We did not care about the distance travelled, the water, etc. In fact, with Euler's strategy, we know exactly when, for any graph, you can find an eulerian circuit.  Let's try to figure out a solution the Königsburg problem... by determining what kind of graphs have eulerian circuits.  Let's take a tour on our new Königsburg graph, and each time we visit and each time we leave a vertex, we will give that vertex a point. For example, if we start at vertex and travel to and then to , then and have 1 point each while has 2 points.      As we keep touring through our graph, we will continue to update the points of each vertex. The points actually tell us how many edges touching that vertex are a part of our tour.   One-point vertices   How can the vertex have 1 point?    Either is the beginning or ending of our tour (and not both).     Odd Points   How can the vertex have an odd number of points?    Since we earn points each time the tour enters and leaves a vertex, either is the beginning or ending of our tour (and not both). If the point value is more than 1, then the tour has already arrived and left at least once.     Even Points   How can the vertex have an even number of points?    If is not an endpoint in the tour, each time is visited, it is also left. So must have an even number of points.  If is an endpoint and the score of is even, then the tour must have started at as well.    From questions , , and , we see that a vertex will only have an odd number of points (or adjacent to an odd number of edges in our tour) if that vertex either starts or ends the tour... unless the tour ends where it started.  If our tour is an eulerian tour, then how many points will have? Exactly the number of edges incident with (We call this the ''degree'' of , .). So since no vertex can have an odd number of points in this eulerian tour, we know that the degree of has to be even!  We just constructed a proof for the following theorem.    If graph has an eulerian tour, then is even for any vertex, , of .    The contrapositive of this theorem is, \"If has an odd-degree vertex, then does not have an eulerian tour\". We finally see what Euler saw! Euler took it a step further:    If graph has an eulerian tour, then is even for any vertex, , of . Also, if vertices of are all even, then has an eulerian tour.      So why does the Königsberg graph not have an eulerian circuit?    The Königsberg graph has several vertices adjacent to an odd number of edges.      Connectivity  Let's look again at the graphs in . This time we want to break down our graphs by deleting vertices. In particular, we want to know how many vertices we have to delete in order to break the graph into pieces.      For example, if we delete one vertex from the first graph in (the edges adjacent to that vertex are also deleted), does our graph break into two separate pieces? No. It'll take more than one vertex, but it can be done with two vertices! In , we deleted two vertices (indicated by the red open circles), and now the graph is broken up. We say it is disconnected .      There's a lot we could say about this situation. The two vertices we deleted are a cut set of the graph, and the pieces are called components . After we delete our cut set, if is in one component and is another component, then our cut set is a separating set . In this graph, our cut set had two vertices, so we say the graph is -connected.    In general, the graph is -connected if has a cut set of vertices.    So how connected are the graphs in ?    For each graph in , what is the smallest value of such that is -connected?    The graph on the farthest left is -connected.    Knowing how connected a graph is can tell us other things as well. For example,    If is a -connected graph, , then every vertices of lie on a common cycle of .    Connectivity and cycles do not seem to be immediately related, but graph theorists have discovered that they are related concepts.    Different Paths  Let's play one more walking game. This time we'll look at paths in a graph. A path is like a tour except now vertices can't be revisted. So a path is a tour with unique vertices and edges.       From , can you find a path starting at and ending at ? Can you find more than one?  Try this: after finding a - path, delete the vertices of the path from the graph (but not and ). Then try to find another - path and deleting those vertices as well. Repeat this process as much as possible. How many paths can you find in this way?   The paths you found in are called internally disjoint paths since they have no vertices in common other than their endpoints. Did you find four internally disjoint paths in the graph in ? Good. For a graph with nonadjacent vertices and , is there a way we could count the number of - internally disjoint paths in ?  In , when we found our first - path, we deleted the internal vertices.    After deleting those internal vertices, was the graph still connected?    Yes! If the graph was disconnected, then there would no more paths to find.      How many paths do we need to delete in order to separate and ?    All four of them! Coincidence?    Does this give us some sort of link between - separating sets and the number of internally disjoint - paths?    What is the size of the smallest - separating set in the graph in ?    We need to delete four vertices. Note that is a - separating set.    Woah. So we had four internally disjoint paths and a separating set cardinality four. This is not a coincidence. Let's take graph with nonadjacent vertices and , and let's call the number of internally - paths . Let's also let be the cardinality of a smallest - separating set. In 1927, graph theorist Karl Menger proved this interesting connection.   Menger's Theorem   Let be a graph with nonadjacent vertices and . Then .          The World of Calculus   Text before the first section.    Harnessing  Introduction  \"What is the largest number you can think of?\" Hopefully, you see that is a question with no real answer. Maybe the closest we can come to answering that question is even though we know is not a number.  In fact, is a weird creature. It breaks some of our number-intuition. It feels like just does not behave. For example, can we add an infinite number of numbers and get something finite? We'll see that you can sometimes. Some of our normal addition rules act differently when is involved. For example, can help us show that ? Let's start with , and we know that Can't we do this forever?     This is a problem! Apparently, the associate law of addition doesn't play well with . You'll discuss this example in greater detail in a later course, but this is enough to show that can be very unusual.  Imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms that are all booked. This example is called Hilbert's Hotel and is a great example to show that does not behave with arithmetic like we typically like.        In Hilbert's hotel, how do we accommodate a new customer if all rooms are booked?      In Hilbert's hotel, how do we accommodate new customers if all rooms are booked?      In Hilbert's hotel, how do we accommodate an infinite new customers if all rooms are booked?    Rules like sound impossible, until we consider the strange creature we call .    Not always unpredictable  However, is not completely unpredictable in all cases. Actually, we should say that a pattern trending towards infinity is sometimes predictable.  For example, consider the function . What happens as the variable gets larger and larger (trends towards ).    Fill out the following table and make a decision about what happens to as trends towards .                                                          What's your decision?    So it seems as gets closer to , gets closer to 0. Let's try something else. This time, let's let get close to .    Fill out the following table and make a decision about what happens to as trends towards .                                                          What's your decision?    This time, seems to get larger and larger. We could say that as trends towards (at least from the positive side of the number line), trends towards .  Actually, a graph would make these trends obvious.    The graph of .     Movement On Paper  Trends like the ones we looked at in and are examples of limits , a foundational tool in the study of Calculus. We would write the conclusions from the past activities like We'll save defining limits clearly for your other coursework, but we can think about limits intuitively.  Firstly, we can think of limits as a way to introduce motion on paper. We \"watched\" the behavior of as \"moved\" towards . There are other examples in which we allow the number rectangles or the number of sides or the number terms and so on extend towards . The limit is similar to the play button on a YouTube video. When you see , you can just imagine some sort of movement or change on your paper.  Secondly, the limit is the tool that allows us to tame ... Well, not \"tame\" , but we can utilize with a limit to accomplish some incredible things. We don't tame the Mississippi River, but it is an enormous resource!    So what is Calculus?  Introduction  So what is calculus exactly? Calculus is a multifaceted branch of mathematics that serves as the bedrock of an enormous number of applications in a a huge variety of fields. However, common to all of the underlying ideas of calculus is harnessing through limits to do something.  Let's look at some examples of how, in some cases, we can predict the infinite. The first should be familiar to us.    Limits of Functions   Limit of Functions  Use a table to evaluate (By , we mean we approach from the left side of the number line. Try using numbers like and so on.)     Geometric Series  Earlier, we added an infinite number of times. Can we actually add an infinite amount of numbers and get a finite answer? Calculus says, \"Yes! It is possible.\"  A geometric series is a summation of the powers of a number . So it looks like For a lot of numbers, this sum gets larger and larger, but if , the sum will equal . This should surprise you in some way. We can add up an infinite number of numbers and actually calculate the result with a nice, clean formula!   Finding Geometric Series   Calculuate the geometric series corresponding to :     The value of in this case is , which is less than , so our formula applies.     All of that adds up to ? Wow. What about if we let ?   Another Geometric Series   Calculuate the geometric series corresponding to :     Like , , so        An infinite number of mathematicians enter a bar. The first mathematician says, \"I'll take a drink.\" The second says, \"I'll have half of what he has.\" The next says, \"I will have half of what he (the 2nd mathematician) has.\"  After the fourth mathematician continues this pattern, the bar tender shouts \"HERE!\", slams down two drinks on the bar, and walks away.   Let's look at one more example.     Recursive Sequences  A sequence , , is just an infinite list of terms. A familiar example would be , the sequence of natural numbers. A sequence is different than a set in that the order of the terms matters. So is the term in the sequence . Make sense? The terms in a sequence typically are defined by a rule. For example, if , then   A sequence is a recursive sequence if the rule for involves earlier terms in the sequence. For example, suppose and, after the first term, . Then and so on.   Recursive Terms   What is in our recursive sequence?    The big question is whether this recurvise sequence, like the function and the geometric series we saw earlier, has a limit? The answer is \"yes\", but how would we find it?  If you take an analysis course (Maybe Advanced Calculus or Intro to Real Analysis), you will see questions like this, and to find a limit of our recursive sequence you would have to prove two important pieces of information. First, the terms in our sequence either need to get progessively smaller or larger with each sequential term, and secondly all of the terms must be smaller than some number and larger than another number (That is, for each term .).  If these two facts are true, then the Monotone Convergence Theorem guarantees the recursive sequence has a limit.  To save us some trouble, we'll use Sage to calculate a few terms of our sequence.     Use the Sage cell to make a hypothesis about if either is (1) increasing or decreasing and (2) bound above or below by a number.    It looks like is (1) decreasing and (2) bound above by 1 and below by 0. However, this is just a hypothesis.      Does the recursive sequence defined by and satisfy the conditions of the Monotone Convergence Theorem? (See the solution.)    Yes, it does, but proving that is beyond the scope of what we're doing here. It can be a little complicated.    In mathematics, it's not a good idea to take things for granted, but for the purpose of illustration, suppose we have shown that is decreasing (getting smaller with each term) and always larger than . That means that our sequence does have a limit. Let's call this mysterious limit point , and here's how we find what is.  We know that , and so that also means that (How would the very first term really affect what the sequence approaches towards ?). So   All of that to say that our limit satisfies the equation     Find the limit point of our sequence by solving the equation     This is just algebra at this point. So either or , but we already know that so .    This is a complicated example, but we are highlighting how even though can act strangely, we can use it to answer complicated quesetions... like how this sequence will trend towards !     Newton vs Leibniz  Introduction  Calculus is arguably the greatest human discovery of all time. With calculus, we have significantly increased our understanding of classical physics, electromagnetism, population dynamics, and astronomy. Every text message you send was made possible through calculus. Every time you take a Tylenol, pump your car breaks, or listen to the radio, you are expierencing gifts of calculus. Applications of calculus affect our daily lives in profound ways.  The calculus we have today packaged in nice textbooks is due to the hard work and incredible insight of a lot of incredibly impressive people. Famous mathematicians like Fermat, Descartes, and Archimedes all laid ground work for modern calculus, but the lion's share of the credit often goes to two giants in the mathematical world: Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.  And the story of Newton and Leibniz is not without controversy.    Newton  Considered to be one of the three greatest mathematical minds of all time, Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) expressed a generational talent for science and mathematics. He is referred to as a \"supreme genius\" and was England's champion of science.   Newton is accredited with   discovering the three laws of motion    discovered gravitational force, validating Kepler's laws of planetary motion AND the Copernican model of the solar system.    the potent mathematical tool known as calculus.        More Contributions   Find another contribution to science and mathematics attributed to Newton.    There are several. One example of Newton's contributions is in the area of optics.       Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727)      Newton's Inventions   Newton also is known for several inventions. Do a quick internet search to list two of them.    We'll give one: the reflecting telescope.      Leibniz  Just because you're not a generational super genius like Isaac Newton does not mean that you cannot make significant contributions to the scientific community. During the time of Newton, German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), also developed calculus. More than that, Leibniz is known for his contributions to philosophy, ethics, politics, and library organizational systems.      Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716)   Actually, Leibniz also developed today's standard notation for derivatives and integrals, and his approach to the subject more closely resembles what we do today over Newton's calculus.  Not only that, Leibniz developed our understanding of base-2 number systems: binary. At the machine level, computers operate through binary mathematics. We can thank Leibniz for that.    The Calculus Controversy  Who should get credit for the discovery of modern calculus? You might think it would be easy to share credit, but that is not the way European nations thought of things in the 17th century. Calculus' discovery became a huge source of conflict, and this conflict quickly pitted Newton and Leibniz against each other.  Gotthegist's YouTube video, \"The Calculus Controversy\", tells this story well. Watch the video and answer the following questions.        What did Newton call his version of calculus?      What notation did Leibniz introduce?      When did Leibniz publish his calculus? What about Newton?      What is an infinitesmal?      Who ran a smear campaign in the quest to get credit for campus? Was it successful?      What brand of calculus has stuck around?    Thankfully, the world has mostly moved on from the drama of the origins of calculus. We can simply enjoy the fruit of their labor. Regardless of the story, we should be thankful that Newton and Leibniz both get credit today.     Archimedes' Great Idea  Introduction  Modern Calculus was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton and Gotfriend Leibniz in 1687. But the great mathematician, Archimedes, was really close to developing Calculus in 300 B.C. (Almost 2000 years before Newton and Leibniz!) with the formation of the limit: the starting point of well-defined calculus (though he never used the word ``limit\" in his construction.).    Archimedes of Syracuse    What is this weird number?  To illustrate how Archimedes was thinking about calculus two thousand years before calculus was a known thing, we should think about circles. Ancient cultures were puzzled that every circle carried an unusual trait. It seemed that for a circle with diameter , its circumference was predictable... kind of.   Circumference and Diameter  How many diameter lengths is the circumference of a circle? SETUP SOME ACTIVITY WITH THIS.   It appears that a circle with diamer has a circumference a bit more than . This fact was true with every circle, and each culture attempted by their own estimates to calculate the myserious number that was the ratio of circumference to diameter .  So what is this number? We define as for the circle with circumference and diameter . The Babylonians found to approximate , and the Egyptians used for their estimate. You probably learned something like . Through modern techniques, computers can now calculate to millions of digits, but the true value of eluded the greatest of minds for centuries.  For reference, here are the first 30 digits of .     Archimedes' Estimate  Archimedes was interested in figuring out the very mysterious number of , and eventually estimated to be (or between ). That's really, really close for 300 BC.   How did he develop such a good estimate? Archimedes was exteremly good at calculations, and he knew polygons very well.     He first inscribed a hexagon in a circle with radius like in , and then he noticed that the hexagon's area is a rough estimate of the area of the circle. Let's work that out for ourselves. We can find the hexagon's area by dividing it into six equilateral triangles and finding their area.   The Hexagon's Area   Find the area of one equilateral triangle using the formula for base and height .    The triangle is equilateral, so it has base length . Using pythagorean theorem, we find the height to be . So the area of the triangle is So the area of the hexagon is .    Okay... that's not a great estimate for , but Archimedes realized a dodecagon's area would be a better estimate. Why stop there though? he calculated areas of -gons, -gons, and -gons (all by hand and without modern trigonometry), all inscribed in a circle of radius 1. Archimedes knew that these areas trend towards some number really close to what we now call .  In the illustration below, you can see how the areas of -gons trend towards as goes to . Wait... that sounds like a limit! Archimedes build a limit that in 300 BC.        Calculus in the Movies  Introduction  Using infinitely close approximations displays power of calculus. Did you know that you can see calculus at work when you watch Finding Nemo?  In fact Pixar Studios continually conducts rigorous mathematical research. One of the mathematicians working for Pixar is Tony Rose, the first PhD in mathematics to win an Academy Award!    Numberphile's Math and Movies  YouTube content creators Numberphile visited Pixar Studios to meet with Tony Rose to discuss some of the mathematics behind their movies.        Explain how the concept of a limit has helped Pixar animators.      Why do newer animated movies look better than the pioneers of 3D animation like Toy Story and Ice Age?       Rates of Change  Introduction  Did you know crows give gifts? Some people have found that if you routinely feed local crows or ravens, they will eventually return the favor by bringing trinkets. People have reported that their crow friends have brought bottle caps, sticks, feathers, and miscelaneous shiny objects.   Imagine your friend, Lucas, has a crow friend, and his crow brings him two small gifts a day. So the shoebox where Lucas keeps these gifts grows by two items a day. We can chart it like below.   Crow-friend presents      We see here an example of linear data. That is, if we chart this information, we can see a straight line with equation , where is our initial amount (or -intercept) and is our slope.  What does slope mean exactly? The graph in is , and so the slope is . But what does that mean? The slope refers to how quickly our line is changing... a rate of change . In this case, gifts per day.  This is exactly why the slope formula is The rate of change is measured by \"change in over change in \".    Throwing a Ball  A lot of situations aren't linear, though, right? For example, if our tall friend throws a ball straight up at mph (or feet per second), thanks to gravity which accelerates over time, after seconds, the ball is at height feet.   Ball height over time      This obviously has a rate of change, but our slope formula doesn't seem to make sense anymore. So how do we find how quickly a ball is moving in the air at a given time? Unlike the crow-friend graph earlier, we cannot talk about slope... or maybe we should consider the slope to be variable. So when we talk about velocity, we have to talk about velocity at a given time , since velocity is not constant.  Suppose we want to know how fast the ball is travelling after . This is a difficult question at first, but maybe we can take an average velocity over a short time interval and use this average velocity as an estimate for the velocity at exactly . For example, let's find the average velocity from to . In other words, we look for the slope of the line passing through the points and . We call such a line a secant line .   Our First Average   Use the slope formula to calculate the average velocity of te ball from to .       f(x) = -16*x^2+44*x+6 sl(x) = (f(2)-f(x))\/(2-x) g2 = plot(f, (0, 3), color='blue', linestyle='-', aspect_ratio=.06); g2 += plot(sl(1)*(x-1)+f(1), (0, 3), color='red', linestyle='-', aspect_ratio=.06); g2   We can see the graph of the function modelling the ball and the secant line in . The idea is that the slope of the secant line gives us an estimate for the rate the ball is travelling at . Is this a good estimate?  Probably not.    How could we get a better estimate?    Maybe we should find secant line slopes that pass through points closer to , like the secant line corresponding to times and .    If we take an average over a shorter distance, we can get a more accurate measurement for the instantaneous rate of change at . The Geogebra applet below shows the trend of slopes of the secant lines as our time interval gets smaller.          Use the Geogebra applet to estimate how quickly the ball is traveling at .    It appears to be trending towards .    Notice that the secant line disappears when the time interval is . This is part of the problem, right? We can get a trend of slopes when the time interval is close to , but the slope formula is undefined once we have a time interval length .  There is, however, a special line we call the tangent line that intersects our graph right at and whose slope is the number that the secant slopes are trending towards. The tangent line's slope gives us the instantaneous rate of change that we are looking for. Wouldn't it be nice to have a good way of finding the tangent line's slope?  PIC OF GRAPH WITH TANGENT LINE.    Derivatives and Instantaneous Rate of Change  Remember from that when we talk about trends, we're actually talking about limits. In this case, we're looking at slopes of secant lines as the time interval trends towards 0. This limit gives us the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a given time.  Mathematically, with help of the slope formula, we could say the instantaneous rate of change is and amazingly the simple slope formula we learned in algebra becomes the tool to finding instantaneous rate of change!  This limit is called the derivative , and it is the gateway to understanding movement and change in mathematical terms. Your first semester of Calculus will focus heavily on the derivative, including nice formulas for calculating derivatives and a variety of derivative applications.  Typically, for function , we denote the derivative as , and with this new definition, we see that the tangent line at has equation for any function. With the derivative in our arsenal, we have a more sophisticated method to finding a rate of change than using secant line.    Applications of Derivatives  Introduction  You encountere derivatives everywhere you go.... everytime you hit your car breaks... everytime you take medicine... and everytime you launch a rocket into space. The derivative is an extremely powerful tool. Let's look at a few applications of derivatives.   Applications of Derivatives   With a group of classmates, find four applications of derivatives either through a textbook or the internet.      More Rates of Change  We were not kidding around when we said that derivates are all around us. Any rate of change can be classified as a derivative. We can find examples from biology, chemistry, population dynamics, ecology, economy, and astronomy (among many others).  Let's look at an example.    Suppose you have a tank holds gallons of water, which drains from the bottom in min. By Torricelli's Law , the volume of water remaining in the tank after minutes is   What does the derivative model?    Since gives us the volume of water at time , gives us the rate of change in the water volume at time . That is, tells us how quickly the water is draining from the tank at time .      Suppose that , where is the volume of water remaining in .  How quickly is the water draining after .      Highest and Lowest  If the derivative of is at the value , the instaneous rate of change at is as well. That means the tangent line at has slope and thus is horizontal. What does this mean? When does a function have no change? Or a horizontal tangent line? Many times, these are the places where has either reached a high point or a low point. For this reason, derivatives often help us find the highs and lows.  Suppose we find of fencing at a local flea market (for a price we can't turn down), and we are wanting to build an enclosed field with it. We have the perfect place along a local creek that will serve as one border of our field. The question calculus can help with is \"How do we build a field with the most area possible?\" Should this field be long and then? Should it be square shaped? Somewhere in between? Let's figure that out.  ADD GEOGEBRA ANIMATION OF A FIELD?  We can label the rectangular sides as and (with ), but we need to also setup equations for area and perimeter.    What's the area of the field in terms of and ?             What's the perimeter in terms of and ? Don't forget that the total amount of fence is .    Since one side of the rectangle is the creek, we have perimeter , and so in total we have as a representation of perimeter.    We can use our perimeter equation to express as a one variable function. From there, the equation will help us pinpoint exactly what dimension field has the maximum area.    Express as a function of .    We solve for to get and so     So now we know the area of a our field is . After some simple derivative rules, we obtain .    Solve the equation .    We solve to get .    So is a potential maximum or minimum of , and since is a downward opening parabola, it makes sense that is in fact the maximum. Putting it all together, the largest field we could possibly build has two sides length and one more side length . The area of this field is .  You can imagine there a lot of valuable applications similar to this.      Surfaces  Introduction  Most of our lives is not spent in a 2D world (is any of it?), so why would we only look at mathematics in a 2D world? Most of our experiences are three dimensional, so it only makes sense to think about mathematics in a 3D environment.       There are two ways we can visualize a 3D surface. The first way you might consider is having two independent variables, , and one dependent variable, . So functions of this form are written as   You can see the surface below.         Contour Plots: Connecting 2D and 3D Shapes  There's something familiar about . Where have you seen something like that before? Well, we know is a 2D object: a circle with radius . We so can think of these circles as a part of . If you sliced at height and put that slice on a plate, the result would be the circle .  These slices are called contours or -curves of , and each - curve of a 3D function results in a 2D object. Keep in mind that when you study explicitly defined functions in the 2D sense, you are actually studying -curves of a 3D function.   along with several contours       Contour  What if there's some type of mathematical object whose contour is a 3D surface itself? Can you think of how that would work? Yeah, we would need a 4D surface set equal to a constant. That is,    from several vantage points          Quartic Surfaces     Polar Coordinates  Introduction  The traveling fair is in town! You can see the rides at the fair grounds from the highway as you pass by (and smell the funnel cake). Our friend, Tom, finally worked up the courage to ask out Amy, and so a trip to the fair is their first date.  Their first ride is the bumper cars. Amy drives around the rectangular arena, but Tom's cart is stuck in one of the corners. While he's sitting there, he starts thinking about locations of other carts. The arena is rectangular and can be broken up into a grid of ft sections, and each cart's location is classified by an coordinate.  PICTURE  Coordinates like we see at the bumper cars are called rectangular coordinates (because they fit nicely in a rectangular grid). For example, the point is written to show that is found in the plane by going in the -direction and in the -direction.  But are rectangular grids always the best way to think of things? Tom and Amy move on to the tilt-o-whirl, and even though we could label the coordinates of this round environment using a rectangular grid, there's probably a more efficient way. What if instead of thinking in terms of rectangles, we thought of things in terms of circles? Rectangular coordinates are awkward for round and circular shapes, and so maybe there's a better way. Meet polar coordinates.  Polar coordinates redefine point by . That is, we label our coordinates with a radius and an angle of rotation. We can get to the same point by going out a distance of and rotating  as pictured.    rectangular coordinates     polar coordinates     So the rectangular point can be written in polar coordinates as .    Converting Coordinates  How can we go from rectangle world to circle world? Obviously, with triangles.   converting to polar coordinates    Notice the values of and form a right triangle, and so by Pythagorean theorem and a little trigonometry, and (or maybe more usefully said: ).    Convert into polar coordinates.    Trigonometry can also help us go from polar to rectangular coordinates.    Using the same triangle as before, determine and .         There we have it! We use and to convert coordinates from polar to rectangular.    Conver polar coordinate into rectangular coordinates.      Polar Functions  Ancient cultures spent a lot of time watching the sky. They built calendars, determined seasons, and even navigated across oceans with the help of positions of stars. Some cultures crafted stories around constellations while others saw their gods in the planets.   Retrograde Motion of Planets     Tracking the position of planets and stars was crucial to society, but planets behaved erratically by sometimes travelling backwards! This motion is called retrograde motion, and it is an interesting phenomenon due to planets' elliptical orbits. Retrograde motion led astologists to these amazing \"dances of planets\".   The 8 year dance between Earth and Venus        The vertical line test says amazing plots like these are not functions. What we really mean is that they are not functions with independent variable and as a function of , However, in polar coordinates, plots like these would be right at home. We can treat as a function of the independent variable . So typically represents a polar function.    Polar Coordinates in Desmos  We can easily view polar functions in Desmos by simply typing an equation . Let's see what kind of functions we can create.   Polar Function Intro  Try plotting . You can type by typing \"theta\".      The function is known as the Archimedean spiral or the golden spiral and is related to Fibonacci sequence. As for Desmos, notice bounds of are automatically added, and you can adjust that range as needed. Let's try a few more polar plots.      Plot .         Plot .      Plot and change the value of with a slider.         Plot and insert a slider when prompted. (Hint: Desmos cannot recognize . Try typing .)         Showing Off Polar Plots  In a small group, make a Desmos plot of polar plot (or plots) to share with the class. The class will vote, and the winning group will be the \"Polar Royals\".         Worlds of Algebra   Algebra    Pipe Algebra  If you were born sometime after the mid-80's, chances are you have played a popular game featuring a pair of Italian plumbers. Something about pipes.  Imagine a pipe network like the one in . In this figure, we mark the volume of water moving across these pipes over a given period of time (we call that the flow rate ) as well as the direction of flow along the pipes. As you can see, we can measure the flow rate on some of the pipes, but not all of them. But we would really like to know the how much water is passing through all of them.     At each intersection point, you might notice there are some pipes flowing into that point and others flowing out. Actually, that observation might give us some insight.    Suppose we know that 100 cubic meters of water is flowing into one intersection point. How much water is flowing out of that intersection point?    The water can't stay at the intersection point, so 100 cubic meters is flowing out from that point.    We now know that at a given intersection point, the total that flows into the intersection is the same as the total flow that flows out from that intersection point. This introduces an equation! This principle is referred to Kirchoff's Law of Flow .  So our question is, \"What possible values along the pipes marked through satisfy Kirchoff's Law of Flow?\" If we can answer this question, then we will know all of the flowrates along our pipe system.    Algebra Shapes and Groups  Introduction  Imagine a game board with four squares (like a chessboard) labelled through , and one token placed on a square. This is a rather simple game, all we can do is move the token to the right, and if the token moves off the board, it goes back to spot .  We can map out all possible moves of this game with a simple chart. We'll write to mean the token starts in slot and travels moves to the right.    Fill out the chart of all possible moves of the token on a chessboard.                                                                        This game is rather boring... is it even a game? But it illustrates how we can uncover the underlying structure mathematically of something.    Algebra's Goal  If we ever make contact with an extraterrestrial society, how could we ever hope to communicate with them? We think that mathematics is our best chance of communicating with intelligent life. We are pretty confident that if they have the means to send and receive messages, they will have an understanding of mathematics.  But what does their alien math look like? We would be very suprised to find the Mean Value Theorem or the Four Color Theorem in their writings, right? At least with the same phrasing we use, BUT we would not be surprised if they had their own versions of these results.  Modern algebra seeks to explore \"deeper\" structures of mathematical systems, so that we can recognize familiar math in unfamiliar environments. Can we find the big picture patterns of mathematics? That is our goal with higher algebra.    A Familiar Pattern  Let's find another underlying structure. Define the set where , and consider multiplication in this set. We should point out that if we multiply two things in , the result is also in , and this property is called closure . As an example,     Fill out the multiplication table for set                                                                         Do you notice any similarities between and ? Tables like these are called Cayley Tables , and one use of Cayley Tables is highlighting patterns. Even though we have different contexts, different sets, and even different operations, in some way they are the same thing.   Underlying Cayley Table     Algebraists can show that the context of the token on the chessboard and the multiplicative powers of are, in fact, the same. What we mean, actually, is that they operate the same way. We say they are isomorphic (meaning \"same shape\"), and in an algebra course we can prove these things are isomorphic.    What is a Group?  Introduction  Both of the previous examples are examles of one of the simplest algebraic structures: the group . We have found two groups, so far, and highlighted that they are isomorphic, but what exactly is a group?  The group is a set paired with an operation (let's say ) that satisfies a short list of properties. The first two are familar to us.   the closure property: if , then     the associative property: for any ,      To show the last two properties, let's consider the two examples we discussed earlier. Let be paired with multiplication as earlier, and let be paired with addition defined by such: the token starting at square moving squares to the right will rest on square .    Identity Elements  How is a number affected when multiplied by ? What about when summed with ?  By using the Caylet Tables from earlier, we can see in set , there is an element, , so that for any other element , . In other words, multiplying by changes nothing. An element like is known as the identity of .    What is the identity of the group with operation ?    The identity is .      What is the identity of the group with operation ?    The identity is .    The third property of groups is that every group has an identity . There is an element such for any element , .    Inverse Elements  Consider the token game once again, and suppose we start on square and move spaces to right to end up on square . Can we make another move to end up back on square ? In general, if we start on square and move squares to the right. We can only move right, but is it possible to keep moving right until we end up back on square ?    After moving squares, starting at square , determine how many squares you must traverse to get back to square for .    If , we must move squares. If , we must traverse squares to return to square . Similarly, we travel squares and square respectively for respectively.    So for any square , there is a number of squares that results in landing on square . In other words, for any , there is a where . In this case, we say is the inverse of . Remember that serves a special role in : the identity.  The last property of group is the inverse property . That is, for any , there is an element , where , where is the identity of . In other words, starting with any element, we can get back to the group's identity through the inverse. We often denote the inverse of as .    Determine the inverses of the elements of .    We know , so is its own inverse. Also , and so and are inverses of each other. Lastly, , and so is its own inverse.       Why do we think about groups?  If we can prove a statement about a generic group , then we know that statement will apply to any group we find! Knowing things about groups will help us find the familiar patterns in unfamiliar environments.  So proving a statement about a group proves statements in an many different contexts (sometimes an infinite number of contexts). Thinking in generalized terms is a powerful way to approach math, and mathematicians like to generalize for that very reason.  For example, here are some things we know about groups.   Let be a group. Then    has exactly one identity.    for any , has exactly one inverse.    for any , .    for any ,         You might know some groups already. Do you think the following sets are groups with the given operation?    Is set with operation a group? If not, why? For our purposes, just think about the identity and inverses.    all integers; addition     all real numbers; addition     all real numbers; multiplication     all real numbers except ; multiplication           all integers; addition  Yes! The identity is , and the inverse of is .     all real numbers; addition  Yes! The identity is , and the inverse of is .     all real numbers; multiplication  No! :( The identity is , but for any . So has no inverse.     all real numbers except ; multiplication  Yes! The identity is , and the inverse of is . If is not in the picture, we can never obtain through multiplication.         A Group of Squares  Let's look at one last example of a group. Take a square with corners labelled (We would recommend cutting one out of paper), and we will say a \"symmetry\" of the square is an action in which we pick up the square, do something to it, and put it down again so that it takes up the same space it did before. For example, we can rotate the square , and it will rest on the exact same space where it started.  There are eight symmetries of the square. Can you find them?    What are the eight basic symmetries of the square?    There are four rotations: rotating , , , .  There are also four flips: flip along a horizontal axis, along a vertical axis, along a northwest diagonal, and along a northeast diagonal.    Let's call this set of symmetries . Here, we call a rotation of  .  FIGURE  What if we did two of these symmetries? Do we get something new? For symmetries and , the composition is the result of first applying and then applying .  For example, means we first rotate the square and then another . Is this a new symmetry? No... it's just . Are any of them new?    In groups, fill out a Cayley table for . Don't assumer that  shows a calculator for the symmetries of a squre. This may be useful!                                                                                                                                                                                                     Symmetries of a Square Calculator    So does with form a group? You just showed it is closed. We will tell you it is associative. Does have an identity? Yes, . Does have inverses?    What are the inverses for elements of ?        Discovering New Mah   Text before the first section.    The Biggest Prime  Introduction  What's the largest number you can think of? Can you ever really answer that question? Maybe not truthfully, but maybe we can ask about certain types of numbers.  What about primes? Is there a biggest prime? Euclid, in 300 BC, told answered this question with \"no\". He showed us that there an infinite number of primes. But surely there is a largest prime that we know of... right?    Without consulting any references, what's the largest prime number you can think of?    But what about all of humanity? What is the largest prime that we know of?   In 2020, the MAA magazine, Math Horizons, featured an article by Scott Williams, \"How Big is the 'Biggest' Prime?\". Read this article to answer the following questions.  What was the largest known prime number as of 2020?  What are Mersenne primes?  What organization is in search of Mersenne primes? How many have been discovered since the search began in 1996?  What are some other categories of prime numbers other than Mersenne primes?  What size LEGO brick would be required to span the observable universe? How does this compare with the largest known prime number?  What other scales of measurement does the article use to put in perspective how large the largest known prime number is?
